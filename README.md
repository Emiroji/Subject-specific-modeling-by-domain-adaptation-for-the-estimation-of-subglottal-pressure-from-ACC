## Overview

Subglottal pressure \(P_s\) is a physiologically critical variable for understanding voice production and diagnosing voice disorders. Direct measurement of $P_s$ is invasive and impractical for ambulatory monitoring. This work presents a method for estimating $P_s$ from non-invasive neck-surface acceleration (ACC) signals using a subject-specific machine learning framework that includes domain adaptation from synthetic to in vivo data.

The following diagram illustrates the modeling pipeline proposed in the paper, combining training with synthetic data and subject-specific adaptation with in vivo ACC signals:

The approach combines:
- Physiologically inspired synthetic data from a voice production model
- Neural network-based regression
- Transfer learning for domain adaptation to real-world subjects
